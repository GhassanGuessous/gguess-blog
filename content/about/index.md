# Hello, 

I’m a software engineer but beyond that, a curious human being who enjoys learning, building, and evolving.

When I’m not working with code, I lean into an active lifestyle through strength training, trekking, and running (getting back into  it after a long break).

I’m always happy to connect with like-minded people. You’ll find my social links below.
